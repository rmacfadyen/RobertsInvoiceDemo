# Robert's Invoice Demo

This demo shows a grid entry for invoice line items. The grid starts
with three empty line items to show the user that multiple entries are
allowed, and that the underlined fields are where values can be entered.
The "Add a row" link is positioned immediately below the rows so the 
user knows that more rows can be added as needed.

The demo also sneaks in an example of Robert's custom date and time 
picker. The nice thing about this date time picker is that when time 
entry is  configured the user can just type the date and then the 
time. Or the user can pick a date and then add the time.

The demo is built using typescript, jquery and jqueryui. While somewhat
out of favor,  jqueryui's interactions, specifically sortable, are still
top shelf.
